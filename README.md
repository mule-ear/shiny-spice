This sketch drives two 7 segment displays using a common bus to drive 2 78HC273 Octal D-type flip-flop with reset; positive-edge trigger - which , in turn, drive 2 - 7 Segment Displays.

While the project is valid - It was a learning roject for me - both in programming Arduino and in using git.

I think this is going to be the base of my modular test equipment project. It can easily be modified to display any two - four digit number from any source - eg. two(or more)  Arduinos networked together using I2C or SPI. The Analog pins are unused ATM.
